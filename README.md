## BIKE-ESP32
BikeEsp32 is a final project made by Sybe Van den Bergh.
I am a 16 year old student Informatica and Datacommunication Science.
Since this project has just started I will not accept any pull requests, I can accept this kind of requests as of July 2026 when I graduate.




## The Project
This project features a ESP32-S3 devkit equiped with 16MB ROM and 8MB PSRAM, to connect al sensor and actuators there is a PCB. The board is programmed using VSCode on PlatformIO. The chosen platform is Arduino meanly because that is what we use at school, but also because of the great support.
