## BIKE-ESP32
BikeEsp32 is a final project made by Sybe Van den Bergh.
Sybe is 16 year old student Informatica and Datacommunication Science.
Since this project has just started I will not accept any pull requests, I can accept this kind of requests as of July 2026 when I graduate.




## The Project
This project features a custom ESP32-S3 board, used to connect all sensors and actuators. The board is programmed using VSCode on PlatformIO. I have chosen for the Arduino framework since we have learnt to programm using an Arduino board.
